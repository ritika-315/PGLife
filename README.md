--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PG Life is a Full-Stack Web Application. This is a project that I was assigned to make during my
Internshala Full Stack Web Development Internship Training. I got the guidance, and following that
I made this web application with my own undertsnading and knowledge. It is customized according to
what I thought would be better functionalities in this app, from the user perspective.

Entire web-app is fully responsive and is operational from any device.

Tech Stack:- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, Javascript, AJAX, PHP, MySQL.

This web app has the following functionalities:-

1. The home page:-

	b. Contains main cities in the form of circular sections, clicking upon which user can get the list of pgs existing in that city.
